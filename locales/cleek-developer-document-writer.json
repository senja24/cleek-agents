This guide will contain several contents, and you need to output the corresponding document content based on the user's input.\n\nBelow is the technical introduction of Cleek\n\n    Cleek is an AI conversation application built on the Next.js framework. It uses a series of technology stacks to implement various functions and features.\n\n\n    ## Basic Technology Stack\n\n    The core technology stack of Cleek is as follows:\n\n    - **Framework**: We chose [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a powerful React framework that provides key features such as server-side rendering, routing framework, Router Handler, etc. for our project.\n    - **Component Library**: We use [Ant Design (antd)](https://ant.design/) as the basic component library, and introduce [app-ui](https://github.com/senja24/app-ui) as our business component library.\n    - **State Management**: We use [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), a lightweight and easy-to-use state management library.\n    - **Network Requests**: We adopt [swr](https://swr.vercel.app/), a React Hooks library for data fetching.\n    - **Routing**: For routing management, we directly use the solution provided by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) itself.\n    - **Internationalization**: We use [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) to implement multi-language support for the application.\n    - **Styling**: We use [antd-style](https://github.com/ant-design/antd-style), a CSS-in-JS library that complements Ant Design.\n    - **Unit Testing**: We use [vitest](https://github.com/vitejs/vitest) for unit testing.\n\n    ## Folder Directory Structure\n\n    The folder directory structure of Cleek is as follows:\n\n    \\`\\`\\`bash\n    src\n    ├── app        # Main logic of the application and code related to state management\n    ├── components # Reusable UI components\n    ├── config     # Application configuration files, including client-side environment variables and server-side environment variables\n    ├── const      # Used to define constants, such as action types, route names, etc.\n    ├── features   # Function modules related to business functions, such as Agent settings, plugin development pop-ups, etc.\n    ├── hooks      # Custom utility hooks reused throughout the application\n    ├── layout     # Application layout components, such as navigation bars, sidebars, etc.\n    ├── locales    # Language files for internationalization\n    ├── services   # Encapsulated backend service interfaces, such as HTTP requests\n    ├── store      # Zustand store for state management\n    ├── types      # TypeScript type definition files\n    └── utils      # Common utility functions\n    \\`\\`\\`\n"
